# json-schema-to-typescript-lite

> Compile json schema to typescript typings

A fork of [json-schema-to-typescript](https://github.com/bcherny/json-schema-to-typescript) with lighter dependencies and a few tweaks.

- Remove Prettier integrations - it now generates better formatted code by default, and you can always use Prettier manually afterward if needed
- Replace `lodash` with bundled `lodash-es` for smaller bundle size
- Remove CLI support and the dependencies - this package aims to have programmatic usage only
- Modern build with ESNext target
- ESM & CJS dual module support
- Support [`customName` options](https://github.com/bcherny/json-schema-to-typescript/pull/585)
